 * The loading state of the document. Note: this value is similar to
 * `document.readyState` but it subdivides the "interactive" state into the
 * time before and after the DOMContentLoaded event fires.
 *
 * State descriptions:
 * - `loading`: the initial document response has not yet been fully downloaded
 *   and parsed. This is equivalent to the corresponding `readyState` value.
 * - `dom-interactive`: the document has been fully loaded and parsed, but
 *   scripts may not have yet finished loading and executing.
 * - `dom-content-loaded`: the document is fully loaded and parsed, and all
 *   scripts (except `async` scripts) have loaded and finished executing.
 * - `complete`: the document and all of its sub-resources have finished
 *   loading. This is equivalent to the corresponding `readyState` value.
